6/15/2021 Basic tutorial example for using JS Matter, a 2D rendering framework. 
 
6/16/2021 Finished final version of this maze app for the course. The colors are awful, the overall "feel" of the ball is ugly, but the functionality of the game works. The most important thing I learned was the really complex (to me) creation of physical constructs using Matter JS. What I'm finding is there is a lot of opportunity in most of these projects to continue working on them and making them more fun and functional.
